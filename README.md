# Mind Settlers Nuxt

> This is a protoype project. It's purpose is to find out if it can replace current Vuejs installation with SSR configuration.

Questions are:

1. Can we make Firestore work on server side?
2. How does the static page generation function?
3. How can the migration from the current VueJS project to Nuxt work?
4. Will work be easier or harder with Nuxt?


## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```


For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
