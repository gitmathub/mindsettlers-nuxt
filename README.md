## Credits

I followed the instructions of the Medium article of Pascal Luther: [Nuxt.js (v2), Firestore & SSR](https://medium.com/@pascalluther/nuxt-js-v2-firestore-ssr-938d8fb7d2b0). All worked from the very first beginning.

The initial setup is based on: https://github.com/nuxt/create-nuxt-app

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
